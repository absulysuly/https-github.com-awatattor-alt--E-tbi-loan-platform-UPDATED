HOW TO SHARE TBI LOAN PLATFORM WITH AI CHAT SYSTEMS
===============================================================

Since AI chat systems (DeepSeek, Chat.ai, Claude, etc.) cannot access 
your GitHub repository, use these documentation files instead:

===============================================================
OPTION 1: QUICK OVERVIEW (Recommended for first contact)
===============================================================

File: QUICK_AI_CONTEXT.md
Size: ~3 KB
Best for: Getting AI to understand your project quickly

HOW TO USE:
1. Open QUICK_AI_CONTEXT.md in a text editor
2. Copy the ENTIRE content (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
3. Paste into your AI chat conversation
4. Say: "Please review this project documentation"

===============================================================
OPTION 2: COMPLETE PROJECT CONTEXT (For detailed analysis)
===============================================================

File: AI_CONTEXT_COMPLETE_PROJECT.md
Size: ~23 KB
Best for: Detailed code review, debugging, enhancements

INCLUDES:
- Complete source code for all components
- Full AI risk assessment algorithm
- TypeScript type definitions
- Mock data examples
- Implementation details

HOW TO USE:
1. Open AI_CONTEXT_COMPLETE_PROJECT.md in a text editor
2. Copy the ENTIRE content (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
3. Paste into your AI chat conversation
4. Say: "This is my complete project. Please analyze it."

===============================================================
WHAT TO TELL THE AI
===============================================================

Example prompts after pasting the documentation:

For General Understanding:
"I've shared my TBi Bank Loan Assessment Platform documentation. 
Please review it and let me know if you understand the project."

For Code Review:
"Please review my AI risk assessment service and suggest improvements."

For Feature Development:
"Based on this project, help me add a new feature for [feature name]."

For Debugging:
"I'm having an issue with [specific component]. Can you help debug it?"

For Optimization:
"How can I improve the performance of this application?"

===============================================================

TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS
===============================================================

1. START WITH QUICK CONTEXT
   - Use QUICK_AI_CONTEXT.md first
   - Only share full context if AI needs more details

2. BE SPECIFIC
   - Ask specific questions about components
   - Reference file names and line numbers if possible

3. PROVIDE CONTEXT
   - Tell the AI what you're trying to accomplish
   - Explain any issues you're experiencing

4. ITERATIVE APPROACH
   - Start with overview questions
   - Drill down into specific areas as needed

===============================================================
EXAMPLE CONVERSATION FLOW
===============================================================

YOU: [Paste QUICK_AI_CONTEXT.md content]
     "Please review this project documentation."

AI: "I've reviewed your TBi Bank Loan Assessment Platform. 
     It's a React/TypeScript application for credit risk 
     assessment. How can I help you with it?"

YOU: "I want to add a feature that allows filtering 
     applications by risk level. Can you help?"

AI: [Provides implementation guidance]

YOU: [If AI needs more details, paste relevant component code]

===============================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
===============================================================

If AI says it can't access GitHub:
✓ Use the markdown files instead (this is the solution!)

If AI doesn't understand the project:
✓ Start with QUICK_AI_CONTEXT.md
✓ Then share AI_CONTEXT_COMPLETE_PROJECT.md if needed

If AI asks for specific files:
✓ Open the file from your local directory
✓ Copy and paste its content into the chat
