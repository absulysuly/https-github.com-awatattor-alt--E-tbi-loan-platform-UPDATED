## 🔄 Database Setup Required

The backend is **fully built and compiles successfully**, but requires a PostgreSQL database to run. Here are your options:

### Option 1: Local PostgreSQL Installation
```bash
# Install PostgreSQL on Windows
# Download from: https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/

# After installation, create the database:
psql -U postgres
CREATE DATABASE tbi_loan_db;
\q

# Run migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Seed the database
npm run db:seed

# Start the server
npm start
```

### Option 2: Docker PostgreSQL
```bash
# Run PostgreSQL in Docker
docker run --name tbi-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres

# Wait a few seconds, then create database
docker exec -it tbi-postgres psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE tbi_loan_db;"

# Run migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Seed the database
npm run db:seed

# Start the server
npm start
```

### Option 3: Use SQLite (for testing only)
If you want to quickly test without PostgreSQL:

1. Update `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
   ```

2. Update `prisma/schema.prisma` datasource:
   ```prisma
   datasource db {
     provider = "sqlite"
     url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }
   ```

3. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   npm run db:seed
   npm start
   ```
