## 🔐 Security Considerations

### PII Data Locations
| Entity | PII Fields | Handling |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Applicant** | firstName, lastName, nationalId, DOB, address | Field-level encryption recommended |
| **Document** | content, ocrData | Encrypted at rest, access logged |
| **AuditLog** | ipAddress, userAgent | Retained per policy, no encryption |

### Compliance Checklist
- ✅ Audit all manual overrides (specified in types)
- ✅ ConfigVersion on assessments (implemented in type)
- 🔄 Immutable audit logs (pending DB constraints)
- 🔄 PII encryption (pending Prisma middleware)
- 🔄 Data retention policies (pending scheduled jobs)

### Security Features
- ✅ Session timeout (30 minutes)
- ✅ Account locking (5 failed attempts)
- ✅ Audit logging (all auth events)
- ✅ MFA support (infrastructure ready)
- 🔄 Rate limiting (pending API implementation)
- 🔄 Input validation (pending form implementation)

## 🤝 Human Decisions Required

### 1. Backend Provider Selection
**Options**:
- **Vercel Serverless** (Recommended for MVP)
  - ✅ Fast deployment, auto-scaling
  - ❌ Vendor lock-in, limited customization
  
- **AWS Lambda + API Gateway** (Recommended for Production)
  - ✅ Enterprise-grade, flexible
  - ❌ Complex setup, higher learning curve

- **Express.js on ECS/Cloud Run**
  - ✅ Full control, portable
  - ❌ More infrastructure management

**Recommendation**: Start with Vercel for MVP, migrate to AWS for V1 production

### 2. PII Encryption Approach
**Options**:
- **Application-level encryption**
  - ✅ Full control, granular
  - ❌ Performance overhead, key management

- **Database-level encryption (TDE)**
  - ✅ Transparent, better performance
  - ❌ Less granular, provider-dependent

**Recommendation**: Hybrid approach - TDE for all data + application-level for nationalId/SSN
