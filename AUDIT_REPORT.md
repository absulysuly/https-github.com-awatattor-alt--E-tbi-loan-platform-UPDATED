## Refactor Recommendations

### P0 High-Priority Refactors

#### 1. AI Service Adaptation
**File**: `services/geminiService.ts` → `services/riskAssessmentService.ts`
**Effort**: 8-12 hours
**Risk**: Medium

```typescript
// Original: Event recommendation logic
// Target: Loan risk assessment logic
export class RiskAssessmentService {
  async assessLoan(application: LoanApplication): Promise<RiskAssessment> {
    // Adapt Gemini integration for financial risk analysis
  }
}
```

#### 2. Database Schema Migration
**File**: `prisma/schema.prisma` → New loan-focused schema
**Effort**: 20-24 hours
**Risk**: High

Key adaptations:
- Event → LoanApplication
- User roles for bank personnel
- Audit trail for compliance
- Document storage references

#### 3. Authentication Enhancement
**File**: `lib/auth.ts` → Enhanced with banking security
**Effort**: 6-8 hours
**Risk**: Low

Enhancements:
- Multi-factor authentication
- Session timeout policies
- Role-based permissions
- Audit logging
